red playstyle
 - spawning in frontline haniwa
   - strength in numbers
     - let all the passives stack up
     - remove exile add replenish, to allow lots of usage of the on play action
     - stuff that scales with number of frontline cards
   - make a strong haniwa
     - sacrifice weaker ones to make a stronger one
     - sacrifice from the haniwa count to make strong ones
     - cards that upgrade other cards (yellow synergy)
     - make frontline cards upgradable more than once
   - a strong haniwa that benefits from more frontline cards in hand/draw/discard
   - stuff that scales with exile
yellow playstyle
 - assign many tasks
   - number of current tasks
     - pause tasks to keep them in play
     - stuff that scales with number of active tasks
   - activating tasks quickly
     - cards that activate tasks immediately or tickdown the counter
     - once you get a high enough haniwa count, you can assign lots of tasks at once
   - make assigns more powerful
     - activate more times
     - charge based on number of cards played, then activate end of turn (or some other event)
   - activating in a combo (same turn, start of turn, one after another) makes them more powerful
     - pause/tickdown to control timings
