red playstyle
 - spawning in frontline haniwa
   - strength in numbers
     - let all the passives stack up
     - remove exile add replenish, to allow lots of usage of the on play action
     - stuff that scales with number of frontline cards
   - make a strong haniwa
     - sacrifice weaker ones to make a stronger one
     - sacrifice from the haniwa count to make strong ones
     - cards that upgrade other cards (yellow synergy)
     - make frontline cards upgradable more than once
   - a strong haniwa that benefits from more frontline cards in hand/draw/discard
   - stuff that scales with exile
yellow playstyle
 - assign many tasks
   - number of current tasks
     - pause tasks to keep them in play
     - stuff that scales with number of active tasks
   - activating tasks quickly
     - cards that activate tasks immediately or tickdown the counter
     - once you get a high enough haniwa count, you can assign lots of tasks at once
   - make assigns more powerful
     - activate more times
     - charge based on number of cards played, then activate end of turn (or some other event)
   - activating in a combo (same turn, start of turn, one after another) makes them more powerful
     - pause/tickdown to control timings

red uncommons
 - summons
   - haniwa spy, show cards and scry in various hand/discard/draw piles
   - haniwa retainer, retain adjecent cards + upgrade if they are retain, defence with more retain in hand
   - haniwa follow up dude, something with attacking enemy with debuffs
   - stronk attacker, more strength if more other frontline cards in hand - maybe just make an attack card
   - mana manip dude, bring 0 cost card to top of draw pile, lower cost in hand
 - not sure which one to do, or both
   - summon card for uncommon
   - exile common/uncommon to summon uncommon/rare summon
 - attack that does more dmg with more frontline cards in hand
 - sacrifice = 1 firepower or tempfirepower + maybe exiling frontline cards
 - card or frontline that can command other frontline, aka use the on play function

yellow uncommons
 - attack that scales with how many assign triggers occured during the turn/or highest combo
 - make 1 assign activate an extra time
 - attack card that charges an assign, play assign card again to activate it
   - or make the card count rly long, and assign triggers increase scaling until it activates
   - not long count, let pause synergize
 - forcefully trigger an assign effect
 - assign triggered = gain block/barrier

general uncommons
 - ability gain 1 of each haniwa per turn
 - build barracks, assign then every turn spawn random frontline
   - already with the haniwa commander, but maybe still do it?

red rares
 - attack that does more dmg with more frontline cards in exile
   - feels a little meh
 - create copies of a frontline card, exile original?

yellow rares
 - make all assign activate an extra time
 - maybe make assign permanent? probs hard to show and broken
 - playing an assign draw 1 card? probs broken lmao
   - or ability make assign cards have replenish

general rares
 - extra turn, assigns wont tick down during this extra turn?
