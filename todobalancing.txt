system changes
haniwa resource to be more limited? aka lower the max level to 5
  - maybe we can keep the current max, just increase cost of starter haniwa gen to 1 mana
frontlines gain exile, at upgrade+10 they lose it but gain 1 cost
  - instead of the above, frontlines now dont leave the hand when played, but gain ethereal and 1 extra cost each time they are played
  - or the passive ability only refreshes when card is added/drawn/upgraded, and frontlines exile
  - each time a frontline card is played, all frontlines in hand gain 1 temp cost

new cards
something to increase max haniwa level 3(5), and gain 2(3) of each haniwa
  - maybe no need anymore, keeping max lvl 10
something for assign to increase the counter by 3, and some other effect? - done
  - maybe just do it on the starter haniwa gen
something that gives assignment bonus?
something that puts frontline back into draw?
  - technically ashes to clay does this, so probs ok on this front

exhibit changes
frontline exhibit no changes, the card count increase is probs fine
assign exhibit - every 5 buffs gained, gain a buff assignment bonus or something - done
  - assignment bonus will be the old effect but tied to a buff, ticks down by 1 each draw

update haniwa spy effects? - done
  - spy doesnt lower cost when using ashes to clay, and probs haniwa blitz cos source card isnt the same - fixed
  - just limit spy to 3(5) activations per cycle? and allow reducing cost in hand?
  - make it so in hand has an effect of reducing card cost for cards that move from draw to discard
update haniwa commander effects - done
haniwa upgrader 1(2) for passive count - done
  - and not allow target other upgraders
haniwa bodyguard make onplay not upgrade +2, maybe just +1 - done
  - also make it so dmg reduction only occurs if not blocked (aka barrier or direct)
haniwa exploiter update onplay action to apply random debuffs or spread an enemies debuffs - done
  - or do a single hit of dmg based on number of debuffs
frozen haniwa, dont allow cold count to scale with upgrade, make it just 1(2) - done
full frontal assault, sacrifice all haniwa - done
haniwa biltz, also discard selected cards - done
ashes to clay, increase cost - done
exile summon, keep exile on upgrade, allow selecting 2 haniwa on upgrade - done
cavalry scout replace graze with scry - done
fencer build barricade make more unique cos too similar to prep counter?
cavalry supplies, either keep mana at 2 and increase assign and delay, or reduce it to 1 and give draw/graze? - done
  - can make 1 of the mana in the after assignment, so extra triggers only increase by 1
ultra frontline too similar to exile upgrade, rework or remove - done
  - well maybe it's fine? nothing else puts all upgrades onto a single unit
  - can make exile upgrade do discarding instead? then need to rework the blue card that basically does a similar thing
  - well maybe it's different enough since i can make exile upgrade only upgrade the cards in hand
assign cost trigger only increase cost in hand - done
assign play draw and zero cost reduction, give ethereal and upgrade remove it - done
create cavalry increase scry on upgrade - done
cavalry rush only make mana gain occur once - done
