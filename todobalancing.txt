system changes
haniwa resource to be more limited? aka lower the max level to 5
  - maybe we can keep the current max, just increase cost of starter haniwa gen to 1 mana
frontlines gain exile, at upgrade+10 they lose it but gain 1 cost
  - instead of the above, frontlines now dont leave the hand when played, but gain ethereal and 1 extra cost each time they are played
  - or the passive ability only refreshes when card is added/drawn/upgraded, and frontlines exile
  - each time a frontline card is played, all frontlines in hand gain 1 temp cost

new cards
something to increase max haniwa level 3(5), and gain 2(3) of each haniwa
  - maybe no need anymore, keeping max lvl 10
something for assign to increase the counter by 3, and some other effect?
  - maybe just do it on the starter haniwa gen

exhibit changes
frontline exhibit no changes, the card count increase is probs fine
assign exhibit - every 5 buffs gained, gain a buff assignment bonus or something
  - assignment bonus will be the old effect but tied to a buff, ticks down by 1 each draw

update haniwa spy and commanders effects?
