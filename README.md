## Char overview
Mayumi's playstyle involves managing and creating multiple things at once. Whether you choose to command Frontline units (represented as cards) or Assign tasks (represented as buffs), you will need to manage your resources carefully.  
Both sides require Haniwa resource to use effectively. There are 3 types of Haniwa (Fencer, Archer and Cavalry) all of which can reach up to level 10. They are used for various card effects. 

### Yellow side - Assign
Assign cards are cheap 0 cost cards with various effects, but require Haniwa to play. Their effects are also delayed, which require a certain number of cards to be played before their effect triggers. 
After an Assign buff triggers, the Haniwa spent on them are returned to your pool.  
You can have multiple Assign buffs active at once, but if you don't have the required Haniwa, you won't be able to play more Assign cards until your current ones trigger.  
The 2 main playstyles are to set off as many Assign buffs as possible, or to build up the strength of few Assign buffs.  
A playstyle that can play lots of cards and have various effects going off, but you will need to manage your Assign buffs and their current card counts to ensure you make optimal plays to be able to continue the turn. 

### Red side - Frontline
Frontline cards are retainable cards that have passive effects while in the hand but require Haniwa resource to create. They can also be played for 0 for a separate effect. 
There are currently 10 different types of Common/Uncommon Frontline cards available, each with their own abilities and Haniwa requirements. If you're overwhelmed by the amount of options, the Common rarities are a good place to start with.  
They are upgradable any number of times, so you can choose to create more powerful cards or create a mass amount.  
There are also ways to activate their effects with other cards, so the effects will depend on which Frontline cards you choose.  
A playstyle that is versatile and can have lots of passive effects going on, but handclog and drawing too many cards will be a thing to manage. 

### Side theme - 0 cost cards
Both sides have cards that are 0 cost, thus there are some cards which make use of those.  
Effects such as gaining temp firepower for the number of 0 cost cards, moving 0 cost cards to the hand, playing 0 cost cards lowers costs of other cards etc. 

### Side theme - Haniwa types
The 3 haniwa types each have a general theme to them, with some exceptions.  

 - Fencer - Defence, Followups, Counters
 - Archer - Debuffs, Accuracy
 - Cavalry - Draw, Mana, Graze
