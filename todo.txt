summon cards that sacrifice make mention that you get bonus haniwa by sacrificing less lel
mass summon probs still too good
white flashbang for extra turn spell anims?
make haniwa buffs special type perhaps?
  - or instead let them stay at 0 level without removal
frontlines that dont upgrade should stay at the same passive counter, else people think they keep upgrading when it's only once
ultra frontline break open the passive limit?
  - move SturdyFrontline to unused as it will be redundant with new frontline changes
